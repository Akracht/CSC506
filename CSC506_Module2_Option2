#CSC506_Module2_Option2: Algorithm Analysis
#In this script, I've developed two algorithms (one loop-based and the other recursive)
#to output the daily salary of a worker who, each day, is paid twice the previous day's salary,
#starting w/ .01 for a 30-day period


#Inputs:
days = 30
starting_salary = 0.01
starting_day = 1

#Initialization

def loop_salary(days, starting_salary):
    for day in range(1, 31):
        print(f"On day {day} out of {days}, the worker made ${starting_salary:.2f}")
        starting_salary *= 2
    starting_salary = 0.01
    

def recursive_salary(starting_day, starting_salary):
    if starting_day <= 30:
        print(f"On day {starting_day} out of 30, the worker made ${starting_salary:.2f}")
        recursive_salary( starting_day + 1, starting_salary * 2)
    
#Outputs
loop_salary(days, starting_salary)
recursive_salary(starting_day, starting_salary)
